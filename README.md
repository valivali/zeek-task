This is my Zeek Task..

__Background__


The purpose of this task is to recreate a fragment of our internal back office web based app. In
this app, one can view all vouchers uploaded by customers, approve them, reject them (e.g. if
they are missing some info such as serial number), edit their s/n etc.

I have implemented this task using Angular 1.x

Thank you for taking part in evaluating this work.

Cheers,
V.
